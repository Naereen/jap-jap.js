## üìñ About the Game

**Jap Jap** is a strategic card game where players aim to achieve the lowest hand value possible. The objective is to reduce your hand's total value to 5 or less, at which point you can call "JAP JAP!" to win the round. The first player to reach 90 points loses the game!

### Game Rules

1. **Setup**: Each player (you vs. the computer opponent) starts with 5 cards
2. **Hand Values**: Cards are valued by their rank (Ace=1, 2-10=face value, Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13)
3. **Gameplay**:
   - On your turn, select one or more cards from your hand to discard
   - Valid plays must be either:
     - Multiple cards of the same rank (e.g., three 5s)
     - A consecutive sequence of the same suit (e.g., 4‚ô•, 5‚ô•, 6‚ô•)
   - After discarding, draw a card from either:
     - The deck (hidden card)
     - The discard pile (visible top card)
4. **Winning a Round**: When your hand value is 5 or less, click "JAP JAP!" to win the round
5. **Scoring**: The losing player of each round gains points equal to their hand value
6. **Game Over**: First player to reach 90 points loses the game

### Strategy Tips

- Try to form sequences or pairs early to discard high-value cards
- Watch the discard pile for cards that might help you complete a sequence
- Don't wait too long to call "JAP JAP!" - your opponent might beat you to it!
- Sometimes it's worth picking up a high card from the discard pile if it helps you form a valid play

### AI Opponent Strategy

The computer opponents use an intelligent strategy system:

**Card Playing Strategy:**
- Evaluates all possible plays (pairs, sequences, single cards)
- Prioritizes discarding high-value cards to reduce hand score
- Gives bonus value to plays that discard multiple cards at once
- Considers whether remaining hand has good play opportunities
- Selects the optimal play based on weighted scoring

**Drawing Strategy:**
- Picks from discard pile when the top card can:
  - Complete or extend a pair/triplet (matching rank)
  - Form or extend a sequence (adjacent rank in same suit)
  - Replace high-value cards (picks low cards when holding high average hand value)
- Otherwise draws from the deck for unpredictability

**Winning Strategy:**
- Checks for "JAP JAP!" opportunity at the start of each turn
- Calls "JAP JAP!" immediately when hand value reaches 5 or less
- Reveals hand face-up when calling "JAP JAP!" for transparency
